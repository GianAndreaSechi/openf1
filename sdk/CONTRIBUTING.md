# Contributing to OpenF1
My OpenF1's mission is to add SDK and MCP functionality to [OpenF1 Api](https://github.com/br-g/openf1).
We welcome all contributions that help advance this goal!

## How to contribute code
Follow these steps to submit your code contributions effectively.

1. Open an issue
Before making changes, we recommend opening an issue (if one doesn’t already exist) to discuss your proposed updates. This allows us to provide feedback and validate the changes early.
For minor fixes (e.g., small bug fixes or documentation updates), feel free to skip this step and directly create a pull request (PR).

2. Make your changes
Fork the repository: Start by forking the OpenF1 repository.
Set up your environment: Set up a development environment and ensure that you can run the unit tests locally.
Implement your changes: Make the necessary changes in your forked repository.
3. Create a pull request (PR)
When your changes are ready, create a PR from your fork’s branch to the dev branch of the official OpenF1 repository.
Make sure to include a clear description of the changes and reference the issue (if applicable).

4. Code review
A reviewer will evaluate your PR and provide feedback.
There may be several rounds of comments and code changes before the pull request gets approved by the reviewer.

5. Merging
Once your PR is approved, a team member will handle the merging process.
Your changes will first be merged into the dev branch and later into the main branch after further testing.
